<h1>Spreadsheets</h1>
<p>The creation of digital artefacts will be integral
to much of the learning of computing. Digital
artefacts can take many forms, including digital
images, computer programs, spreadsheets, 3D
animations<p>
<h3> The National curriculum puts it this way: </h3>
<p>create, re-use, revise and re-purpose digital artefacts for a given audience, with
attention to trustworthiness, design and usability</p>
<p>In regard to spreadsheets we could say that the digital artifact is some kind of list or comma separated data and that we are revising this use a spreadsheet application </p>
<h3>Learning Milestones or what do I want my students to have learnt at the end of a lesson or unit</h3>
<ul>
<li> Understand the concept of the data pipeline i.e data is being provided to an application and that application is changing it and producing an amended output.</li>
<li>Understand the grid nature of spreadsheets, how we can refer to rows and columns</li>
<li>Understand and use cells for displaying and formatting values either as a result of some formula or simply as an unchanged value</li>
<li>Use some of the presentation options that can be applied such as adding images, removing borders etc</li>
</ul>
<h3>How will milestones or desired learning outcomes be measured?</h3>
<ul>
<li>Hinge point questioning, maybe a multiple choice question where students raise a card with the answer. This requires that students answer the question and show their response quickly to avoid copying. A variation on this might involve students developing a short answer and the teacher collecting the cards to verify level of understanding</li>
<li>tour the classroom looking for opportunities for learning<li>
<li>open ended questioning , instead of is this a formula ? why is this a formula ? is this a reference ? why is this a reference ?<li>
<li>listen to responses and rather than not quite.. or nearly.. try and determine an error in teaching which you can rectify</li>
</ul>
